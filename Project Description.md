# Wood-cutter-safety-system-
Electrical Sensor and motor based project

The system was proposed in order to reduce the chances of occurance
of accidents in saw industries. It consists of sensor operated disc brake
connected to the shaft of wood cutter, so in case the sawyerâ€™s hand
comes in contact with the moving blade then the sensor senses the
incoming hand and signals the brake to instantly stop the cutter blade
